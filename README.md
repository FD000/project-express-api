# Express API Project

This project was about building an API using Express and was my first introduction to backend.

## The problem

I had problems with adding several queries on top of my api, but managed to solve that by storing my API in a let variable. I then used that variable to filter everytime I added one query. 

Tech & Tools used: 
- RESTful API 
- Postman
- JavaScript
- Node js

List of Endpoints
- '/avocado'    = Renders all available data inside our database.
- '/avocado?id=#'   = Gets you the data with the specific ID that you are searching for.
- '/avocado?amount=#' = Limits your output to an amount of outputs. 
- '/avocado?minPrice=#' = Renders all data that has a min price of selected value.
- '/avocado?maxPrice=#' = Renders all data that is not exceeding our selected maximum price for the product.
